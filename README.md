# 100DaysofCode

## Day 1
*20230320*

Today marks the start of the second week of the **School of Code** bootcamp (cohort 14). I thoroughly enjoyed last week and I am pleased to say that week 2 has got off on the right foot too!

- In the morning quiz my only mistake was mixing up which of `var`, `let`, and `const` are **function-scoped** and **block-scoped** in JS so I was pretty happy with that.
- I met my new programming partners for the week and we worked together on some basic [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) problems.
  - I was particularly happy to have remembered a code snippet from last week (`X % 2 === 0`) that helped us quickly solve a task involving selecting even numbers from an array.
- We had a lecture on the **DOM** and then jumped into a workshop that concerned coding in the functionality for a button to double the number of pennies shown on the screen each time it was pressed.
- As a team we managed to pretty quickly go through all the tasks so we had time at the end to add our own ideas, such as an if...else statement that changed the display from pennies to pounds when appropriate.
  - I threw in a little easter egg after the session too, should anyone spam the button enough times to exceed 1 trillion GBP:
  
 ```js
 function handleClick() {
  console.log("I'm just to prove it's working!");
  pennies *= 2
  if (pennies < 100) {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `${pennies} pennies`;
    titleUpdater(pennies + ' pennies')
  }
  else if (pennies < 100000000000000) {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `Â£${pennies/100}`;
    titleUpdater('Â£' + pennies/100)
  }
  else {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `Â£${pennies/100} - the country has entered hyperinflation ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­`;
    titleUpdater('HYPERINFLATION')
  }
}
```
- Perhaps the most gratifying part of the day was not getting the workshop done but spotting that someone was asking for a hand with a task we had finished and hopping into their breakout room and managing to help them solve the task - I'm sure I'll be relying on help from fellow bootcampers in the future so it feels good to help when I can.
- I also continued to read *"Clean Code"* by Robert C. Martin as per my mentor Shaun's recommendation and got up to the start of Chapter 6. I can't say in good faith that I am able to follow the code examples but the author's explanations of said code have been proving enough of a guide thus far.

In summary, an encouraging start to the week. I'm sure not all of my daily updates will be this long but I am glad to have got going. Here's to 99 days more!

## Day 2
*20230321*

Today was especially interesting as we delved into AI tools and how they can best be utilised to both learn and write code in an efficient manner.

- I got everything right in the morning quiz on the DOM!
  - This is my first time scoring 100% on one of the morning quizzes so I am delighted, whilst at the same time being acutely aware that this hardly guarantees I have internalised everything we have learnt thus far.
- We had a guest lecturer in the form of Piper who was part of cohort 4 of the School of Code.
- Their talk of ongoing impostor syndrome remninded me of similar sentiments expressed by some of my friends whilst at university.
- On a more positive note, they affirmed that your colleagues in tech will always be willing to take time out of their day to get you up to speed on something you do not yet know which is certainly reassuring.
- They also mentioned how companies are often keen to hire juniors specifically for their lack of experience, in the hope that they might be more easily moulded to fit the company work culture than an established developer, which seems a reasonable assumption to me.
- We split off for a short while into berakout rooms and as a trio my partners and I solved two Code Wars kata called [Sentence Smash](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dc23c68a0c93699800041d/train/javascript) and [If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077/train/javascript)
  - The latter was particularly humbling, with one of the submitted solutions achieving in 1 line what we had managed in 9:
```js
countSheep=n=>[...Array(n).keys()].map(x=>`${x+1} sheep...`).join``
```
  - Whilst our offering was:
```js
var countSheep = function (num){
  let murmur = ""
  if (num > 0) {
	  for (let i=1; i <= num; i++) {
	  murmur = murmur + i + " sheep..."
	  }
  }
  return murmur
}
```
- After a lecture covering the `addEventListener()` method, we started on a workshop where we would use ChatGPT and/or GitHub Copilot to rebuild the rock, paper, scissors game from last Friday, now with added DOM functionality
- It never ceases to me amaze me what ChatGPT can do, with a single sentence prompt returning me fully functional HTML, CSS, and JS for a working game.
- What impressed me more, however, was Copilot's autocompletion of my comments in which I was attempting to spell out what each code block was achieving, which on more than one occasion actually helped me understand lines of code that ChatGPT had generated which were, until then, going over my head.
- Lastly, I continued to read *Clean Code* and got to the start of Chapter 8. Hopefully I can get it finished before I meet with my mentor on Friday.

All in all another jam-packed day! I feel like the Copilot autocompletion of comments will prove invaluable in helping me to read code that would otherwise be impenetrable at this early stage in my learning journey.

## Day 3
*20230322*

Today we were introduced to asynchronous JS and APIs which I am sure we will get lots of practice with in the coming days and weeks.

- My only mistake on the morning quiz was a question on what will and will not cause an event on the DOM (it turns out scrolling in the browser window will cause an event!)
- We spent some time in our trios solving Code Wars kata and we managed to get through four of them:
	- [Simple multiplication](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583710ccaa6717322c000105)
	- [Chuck Norris VII - True or False? (Beginner)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/570669d8cb7293a2d1001473/train/javascript)
	- [Sum of two lowest positive integers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/558fc85d8fd1938afb000014/train/javascript)
		- Solving this one introduced me to the syntax for the `.sort()` method: `numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);`
	- [Grasshopper - Summation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d24f55d7dd296eb9000030/train/javascript))
		- Once again our solution was far less elegant than some others on display:
```js
var summation = function (num) {  
Â Â let totalSum = 0  
Â Â for (let i=1; i <= num; i++) {  
Â Â Â Â totalSum = totalSum + i  
Â Â }Â Â 
Â Â return totalSum
}
```
- As opposed to:
```js
const summation = n => n * (n + 1) / 2;
```
- I particularly appreciated this concise solution because it reminded me of a story I had heard in school of Gauss, as a schoolboy, summing the numbers from 1 to 100 in no time at all by deriving the formula used above.
- After a lecture on asynchronous JS we got to work on a workshop coding up hands on a clock that would move in real time atop an image of a clock face.
- We then had a lecture introducing APIs, Promises, and fetch that led into an afternoon workshop building a page that retrieves cat facts at random when a button is pressed.
- As a trio we got through all the tasks of the workshop and even managed to find some time at the end to add an array of cat images that would change at random along with the cat fact on display when the button was pressed.

Another satisfying day today, and I was particularly glad to get the afternoon workshop finished, along with copious comments spelling out what each function was doing step by step. In the future I am sure that these will be superfluous, and indeed reliance on comments is proscribed in *Clean Code* in favour of well written code that speaks for itself but for the time being I find they help me both solidify my understanding of the code I have just written and give me confidence that when I look back over my work, I won't be stuck trying to work out what I was trying to achieve with each line.

## Day 4
*20230323*

There was less time spent coding today than usual as in the afternoon we split into groups and each researched a particular topic.

- I got everything right on today's morning quiz on async and fetch and finished quite quickly to boot which was encouraging.
- We then split into groups and spent some time working on Code Wars.
- We solved a couple of 7 kyuu kata:
	- [Friend or Foe?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b42574ff091733d900002f/train/javascript)
```js
function friend(friends){
  const regex = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;
  for (let i=0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    if (friends[i].length !== 4 || !regex.test(friends[i])) {
      friends.splice(i, 1)
      i--;
    }
  }
  return friends
}
```
- [Get the Middle Character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56747fd5cb988479af000028/train/javascript)
```js
function getMiddle(s)
{
  let stringLength = s.length
  if (stringLength % 2 === 1) {
    let oddMiddle = s.slice(Math.floor(stringLength/2),Math.ceil(stringLength/2))
    return oddMiddle
  }
  else {
    let evenMiddleTwo = s.slice((stringLength/2)-1, (stringLength/2)+1)
    return evenMiddleTwo
  }
}
```
- One of the submitted solutions made use of a JS method that I had not yet encountered, `substring()` to solve the kata in a much simpler way:
```js
function getMiddle(s)
{
  return s.substring(Math.ceil(s.length/2)-1, Math.floor(s.length/2)+1)
}
```
- We then had a lecture by Joseph on cognitive diversity in the workplace in which he talked about personality tests and how we can best get different types of people to work together.
- In preparation for the session we were asked to do [this personality test](https://www.16personalities.com/) and I got "Commander ENTJ-A" which seemed to fit me fairly well, although I am always somewhat sceptical of personality tests such as these so I expect I will take the results with a pinch of salt.
- We then had an engaging lecture by Paavan Buddhev on UX Design.
- Apparently we will be looking into UX Design more next week so that should flesh out my understanding but as things stand it seems like Paavan gets to do some interesting work.
- We then split into groups to research dev tools tabs, and I looked into **lighthouse**.
- We combined our research into a 5-minute video to be shared with our fellow bootcampers.
- We then spent the last half an hour or so working on our first 6 kyuu kata on Code Wars:
	- [Sum of Digits / Digital Root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00/train/javascript)
```js
function summing(n) {
  let digits = Array.from(String(n), Number);
  let summedTotal = 0;
  for (let i=0; i < digits.length; i++) {
    summedTotal = summedTotal + digits[i]
  }
  return summedTotal
}

function digitalRoot(nextSum) {
  let result = summing(nextSum)
  while (result >= 10) {
    result = summing(result)
  }
  return result
  }
```
- This was definitely the longest we have spent solving a kata and we needed a helping hand from ChatGPT near the end to get us over the line.
- As always, there was a better was of doing things, making use of some in-built JS methods that we have yet to come across, elucidated in the submitted solutions:
```js
function digital_root(n) {
  if (n < 10) return n;
  
  return digital_root(
    n.toString().split('').reduce(function(acc, d) { return acc + +d; }, 0));
}
```

Today was a pleasant change of pace with less new material which should hopefully give us all a chance to consolidate everything we have learned thus far this week ready for tomorrow's hackathon.
