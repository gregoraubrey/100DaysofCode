# 100DaysofCode

## Day 1
*20230320*

Today marks the start of the second week of the **School of Code** bootcamp (cohort 14). I thoroughly enjoyed last week and I am pleased to say that week 2 has got off on the right foot too!

- In the morning quiz my only mistake was mixing up which of `var`, `let`, and `const` are **function-scoped** and **block-scoped** in JS so I was pretty happy with that.
- I met my new programming partners for the week and we worked together on some basic [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) problems.
  - I was particularly happy to have remembered a code snippet from last week (`X % 2 === 0`) that helped us quickly solve a task involving selecting even numbers from an array.
- We had a lecture on the **DOM** and then jumped into a workshop that concerned coding in the functionality for a button to double the number of pennies shown on the screen each time it was pressed.
- As a team we managed to pretty quickly go through all the tasks so we had time at the end to add our own ideas, such as an if...else statement that changed the display from pennies to pounds when appropriate.
  - I threw in a little easter egg after the session too, should anyone spam the button enough times to exceed 1 trillion GBP:
  
 ```js
 function handleClick() {
  console.log("I'm just to prove it's working!");
  pennies *= 2
  if (pennies < 100) {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `${pennies} pennies`;
    titleUpdater(pennies + ' pennies')
  }
  else if (pennies < 100000000000000) {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `Â£${pennies/100}`;
    titleUpdater('Â£' + pennies/100)
  }
  else {
    document.querySelector('output').textContent = `Â£${pennies/100} - the country has entered hyperinflation ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­`;
    titleUpdater('HYPERINFLATION')
  }
}
```
- Perhaps the most gratifying part of the day was not getting the workshop done but spotting that someone was asking for a hand with a task we had finished and hopping into their breakout room and managing to help them solve the task - I'm sure I'll be relying on help from fellow bootcampers in the future so it feels good to help when I can.
- I also continued to read *"Clean Code"* by Robert C. Martin as per my mentor Shaun's recommendation and got up to the start of Chapter 6. I can't say in good faith that I am able to follow the code examples but the author's explanations of said code have been proving enough of a guide thus far.

In summary, an encouraging start to the week. I'm sure not all of my daily updates will be this long but I am glad to have got going. Here's to 99 days more!
